I always feel that i need a blog but I never have one.

So I spent some time searching for some excellent templates and cases

Then I found that [Anthony Fu @ antfu.me](https://antfu.me)'s blog was very good, so I took it over and borrowed it for a while. Here, I am very grateful to [Anthony Fu @ antfu.me](https://antfu.me)

As for the blog, I am likely to do some bilingual stuff in the future. Some posts will be written in English, some might be in Chinese. A switch button will be shown then. Also planned to post my photos in this site, which I would need to implement the gallery page for it.

The site is still WIP, if you have any thoughts or suggestions, please tell me via [email](mailto:qtzxly@gmail.com). Thanks!
